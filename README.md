AI Usage in Students’ Life – Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing how students use Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in their daily lives for academics, productivity, learning support, and personal tasks. The project aims to understand usage frequency, key use cases such as assignments, research, and learning, as well as students’ awareness, benefits, and concerns related to AI adoption. The dataset was analyzed using Power BI, where data cleaning, transformation, and visualization were performed to generate meaningful insights. Interactive dashboards with KPIs and filters were created to visualize AI usage trends and patterns in a clear and user-friendly manner. This project highlights the growing impact of AI on modern learning habits and demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and insight-driven reporting.
